       "316      RE : Complaint Against JP Morgan Chase, XXXX Home Lending Advisor, Ms. XXXX XXXX and Manager, Mr. XXXX XXXX SUBJECT : Refinancing Home Loan via Chase Home Loan No.  XXXX Mr. XXXX XXXX, with regards to your deference to Chase Executive office based upon your interpretation of my e-mail dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that the correspondence intimated a threat of suit, perhaps the terseness of the narrative may have animated such an inference, but it was merely a correspondence of frustration invoked by my interpretation of an apparent deficiency of candor in what would appear to be a simple and mechanical process based on basic Standards of Care. \\n\\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX, XXXX Home Loan Advisor, Agent of JP Morgan Chase unacceptable conduct along with email communication that is part of the record clearly supports the allegations of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices. \\n\\nCOMMON SENSE : The Standards of Care which affords common sense to prevail in a style articulated by our SCOUTUS as stated by the following : In interpreting this text, we are guided by the principle that [ t ] he Constitution was written to be understood by the voters ; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning. United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 ( 1931 ) ; see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 ( 1824 ). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding generation. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 ( 2008 ).\\n\\nOBLIGATIONS : In common language, the state of California articulates the predicate for an obligation by stating the following : CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CCP PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS ( Preliminary Provisions enacted 1872. ) 26. Section Twenty-Six. An obligation is a legal duty, by which one person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing, and arises from : One- Contract ; or Two- Operation of law.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1873 -74, Ch. 383 ) COMMON LANGUAGE : The State of  California clarifies the meaning of the terms Contract or by Operation of Law with the following : CIVIL CODE CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGAGTIONS PART 1. OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL TITLE 1. DEFINITION OF OBLIGATIONS 1427. An obligation is a legal duty, by which a person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing.\\n\\n1428. Section Fourteen Hundred and Twenty-Eight. An obligation arises either from : One The contract of the parties ; or, Two The operation of law. An obligation arising from operation of law may be enforced in the manner provided by law, or by civil action or proceeding.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1872 74, Ch. 612. ) A CONTEMPORANEOUS REVIEW OF  EVENTS It was XX/XX/XXXX, when my wife and I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. XXXX XXXX as a JP Morgan Chase, XXXX Home Lending Advisor NMLS ID XXXX, at the XXXX, CA branch where she introduced herself and represented that she has a 10-years tenure with JP Morgan Chase as a Home Lending Advisor. \\n\\nAs the more knowledgeable person, my wife engaged the financial details of the prospective Refinancing details of the conversation with Mrs. XXXX XXXX, articulating : 1. My wife shared with Ms. XXXX that she believed my Credit Score should be in the range of 700 720. \\n2. We disclosed that we did NOT want to take any cash out of the property.\\n\\n3. We also shared with her that we would be paying out of pocket the refinancing cost so please do not wrap any cost into the Loan. \\n4. We asked how long is Chases Refinance process and Ms. XXXX share 45 to 60 days. We asked whether or not if she could complete the process in 30 days since we would not be taking any cash out. She committed to completing the process in 30 days if we were able to forward all of the documents on the list she provided back to her on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. We committed to going home and forwarding to her all of the documents requested on Saturday, XXXX XXXX. \\n5. Ms. XXXX represented that we would not have to do an appraisal since XXXX XXXX the property at ; $ XXXX. \\n\\nMrs. XXXX XXXX further represented : 1. After we provided Ms. XXXX with a copy of our current Mortgage Statement. She completed her Calculation using the automated Mortgage Calculator on her desktop, using a Credit Score of XXXX then changing it to XXXX points. The calculation provided an Interest Rate of 3.87 %. \\n2. Ms. XXXX never disclosed to my wife and I that we would have to provide a Good Faith Fee of {$500.00}. \\n\\nAgain, my wife represented to Mrs. XXXX XXXX at the conclusion of the XX/XX/XXXX, meeting that she would immediately send over the requested loan documents as soon as we arrived home, which, Mrs. XXXX appeared to acknowledge in affirmation since it was before XXXX Oclock XXXX. \\n\\nITENARY OF ACTIVITY My wife sent over all of the documents to Ms. XXXX XXXX as represented as expeditiously upon arrival to home at approximately XXXX XXXX per the e-mail dated XX/XX/XXXX. \\nReply e-mail from Ms. XXXX indicated that she was gone for the day XX/XX/XXXX and would not return to the office until Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. Hello, I am out of office for the remainder of the day. I will however respond to emails Tuesday. For urgent matters reach out to the client care specialist assigned to your loan. Thank you and have a blessed day. Thank you for choosing Chase! \\nWhen we did not her from Ms. XXXX on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, my wife called her late Tuesday afternoon. XXXX represented that she never received the documents even though here email reply when documents were sent stated the above message. \\nMy wife asked XXXX to look into her Spam/Junk Box. That is when she confirmed she had the documents and that she would prepare the Loan Application. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX Ms. XXXX XXXX remits e-mail correspondence articulating the following : Hello, Hope all is well. \\nYour loan application is ready. Please connect with me once you review them. The rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower, [ Fico Scores, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, respectively ], but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do. \\n\\nOne item was missing, the home owners declaration page. \\n\\nPlease send that last item as well. \\n\\nRegards, XXXX If you are not 100 % satisfied with my service or your experience with Chase at any time, please let me or my manager know right away. Our contact information is below. \\n\\nThank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\nMy wife and I sent e-mail correspondence to Ms. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, stating : Hi XXXX : Below you state, the rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower. What is the Fico Score? What is the Rate you are now quoting on the application? \\n\\nWhat is Chase fee on buying down Points, would you kindly itemize them out so that me and my wife can review? \\n\\nWhat does your statement below mean where you state, but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do? \\n\\nLastly, the no-reply @ mail-chasemortgage email link for me to sign-up does not work! Also, if it did work, I would be unable to complete the application due to the fact that you DID NOT provide me with a Loan Application Number. We would like to complete this process within 30 days, which you stated that you would be able to make that work but I cant begin the process without a Loan Application Number as well as knowing what Rate you are now quoting and what my Fico Score is coming back at. Can you provide a copy of the credit report so that I can review it for discrepancies? \\n\\nI, We, look forward to your quick response. \\n\\nBest regards, XXXX XXXX and wife XXXX. \\n\\nLater in the afternoon of Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  EDT, Ms. XXXX XXXX remitted a reply e-mail in response to the Joint e-mail of my wife and I, sent at XXXX XXXX, by stating the following : Hello, I hope all is well. \\n\\nSo, for starters, the information you requested, the credit score range : XXXX  XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nYour mortgage loan number is XXXX.

Our contact information is below. Thank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DECEPTION This communication portends several issues from my perspective ; first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of California CIV 1709 1710, which articulate the following : CIVIL CODE-CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS [ 1427 -3272.9 ] ( Heading of Division 3 amended by Stats. 1988. Ch. 160, Sec 14 ) Part 3. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LAW [ 1708 1725 ] ( Part 3 enacted 1872. ) 1709. One, who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers. \\n1710. A deceit, within the meaning of the last section, is either : 1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true ; 2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true ; 3. The suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact ; or, 4. A promise, made without any intention of performing it.\\n\\n( enacted 1872 ) BACK AND FORTH BANTERING : Emails dispersed from myself to Ms. XXXX XXXX and my wife to Ms. XXXX XXXX, [ cc and her supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX eventually, Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX ] from the period of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicate a pattern of deception enumerated in CIV 1710 ( 1 4 ) and may concurrently be in contravention of GOV 12927 ( c ) ( 1 ), which articulates the following narrative in part : GOVERNMENT CODE - GOV TLE 2. GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [ 8000 - 22980 ] ( Title 2 enacted by Stats. 1943, Ch. 134. ) DIVISION 3. EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT [ 11000 - 15986 ] ( Division 3 added by Stats. 1945, Ch. 111. ) PART 2.8. DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING [ 1290012996 ] ( Part 2.8 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) CHAPTER4.Definitions [ 12925-12928 ] ( Chapter 4 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) 12927.

Requirements for certain mortgages : ( a ) Disclosures ( 1 ) Specific disclosures in addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602 ( aa ) [ 1 ] of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size : ( A ) You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.\\n\\n( o ) Affiliate defined for purposes of this section ; the term affiliate has the same meaning as in section 1841 ( k ) of title 12.\\n\\n( 1 ) Exemptions the Bureau may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections ( c ) through ( i ), if the Bureau finds that the exemption ( A ) is in the interest of the borrowing public ; and ( B ) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.\\n\\n( 2 ) Prohibitions : The Bureau, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with ( A ) mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this section ; and ( B ) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\\n\\nThe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of Chase, which appears to countervails 15 U.S. C. 1639 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) is the following statement : Ms. XXXX as an Agent for JP Morgan Chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that : 1. JP Morgan Chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering Loan Terms and Interest Rate to me and my wife. \\n\\n2. She lied when she presented to me and my wife that JP Morgan Chase selection of the lowest Fico Score was due to Chases Guideline ( s ) /Policy. \\n\\n3. When we asked for a copy of Chases Guidelines, she and her Manager, Mr. XXXX lied when they stated that JP Morgan Chase Guidelines are Internal documents and are not given out. \\n\\n4. When Ms. XXXX tried to cover Ms. XXXX lie. XXXX XXXX instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written Quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because Chase does meet their Competitors Pricing and Interest Rate. However, when we submitted a written Quote from a competitor, Mr. XXXX in support of Ms. XXXX stated in an email communication that Chase DOES NOT meet competitors pricing and since we had NOT provided a {$500.00} Good Faith Fee and did not submit all documentation [ which we did ] we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the XXXX Fico Score and Pricing or cancel the process. \\n\\n5. Ms. XXXX email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors Pricing/Interest Rate using a XXXX Fico Score as Ms. XXXX instructed us to do with the words, where did you get this from. Never addressing that fact that the Interest Rate quoted was 3.625 % and we did what she asked of us.\\n\\n6. Ms. XXXX was asked NOT to load ANY of the cost into the Loan. She did it anyway and when asked several times to update the Loan Amount she did not complete that task until Friday, XXXX XXXX evening when she was on her way out the door for the week. \\n\\n7. Ms. XXXX lied when she sent me the initial MyHomeChase email to login and/or create login credentials in order to begin the process. Ms. XXXX FAILED to provide me with the Loan Application Number. When my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the 24 hours account creation expired, Ms. XXXX stated that she did not provide the Loan Application Number because she wanted me to give her a call when I discovered that I could not move forward. \\n\\n8. It was during my wife phone conference with Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that he confirmed the lies that Ms. XXXX represented on behalf of Chase. It was disclosed that Chase DOES uses the Middle Fico Score not the lowest. It was also disclosed that Chase did not have any such Guideline ( s ) /Policy of using the lowest Fico Score as previously represented to us by Ms. XXXX XXXX It was disclosed that Ms. XXXX did NOT 10 years of experience as a Home Loan Advisor with Chase. Mr. XXXX further confirmed that Ms. XXXX has worked for Chase for several years as a Teller along with assisting other Loan Advisors. I believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that Ms. XXXX has worked on ALONE. \\n\\nMr. XXXX in Good Faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to Chases XXXX location, but my wife decided to give Ms. XXXX the benefit-of-the doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process. \\nI believe Mr. XXXX XXXX stated to my wife that he had a conversation with Ms. XXXX regarding the issues. \\n\\nHowever, it was a BIG MISTAKE to leave Ms. XXXX in place. It also appears that the conversation that Mr. XXXX had with Ms. XXXX DID NOT WORK! \\nThroughout Friday, XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon Ms. XXXX sent me several misleading emails informing me that my Loan Documents were ready for me to login to MyHomeChase to complete the loan application process and to paid the {$500.00} Good Faith Fee. \\n\\nI emailed her to alert her that the documents had NOT been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents. She then sent me another email late Friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents. I waited for I believe 2 hours and I emailed her back to share with her that I had not received the separate email. Later in the afternoon/early evening my wife placed a call to her. Her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nShortly, after that the separate email arrived. I login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the OLD documents. I email Ms. XXXX back with both Mr. XXXX & Mr. XXXX on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting Ms. XXXX with hanging the revised documents. Neither Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX responded. \\n\\nHowever, Ms. XXXX did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on Monday and that the only thing she did was to change the Loan Amount. \\nShe went on to let me know that Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned ALL of the above behavior is a clear representation of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices which my last email on Friday, XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX responded back to and forward to his Executive Office clearly reflects my DISDAINED for being subjected to [ 2 Trusted Agents of JP Morgan Chase ], Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX Fraudulent and Unlawful Conduct.\n",

about a debt you are trying to collect. You contacted me by phone and direct mail. Your office has identified a debt that was quoted from a debt buyer. Currently, I demand complete authentication of debt ownership. Your office will be reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the operation of a fraudulent scam operation, claiming ownership of debt that simply does not belong to your agency, and therefore I am still protected under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Your office must cease and desist all further activities against me for this illegal collection practice immediately and purge my personal information from your collection operations permanently. \\n\\n[ any information they gave you about the debt ]. Please supply the information below so that I can be fully informed : Why you think I owe the debt and to whom I owe it, including : The name and address of the creditor to whom the debt is currently owed, the account number used by that creditor, and the amount owed. \\n\\nIf this debt started with a different creditor, provide the name and address of the original creditor, the account number used by that creditor, and the amount owed to that creditor at the time it was transferred. When you identify the original creditor, please provide any other name by which I might know them, if that is different from the official name. In addition, tell me when the current creditor obtained the debt and who the current creditor obtained it from. \\n\\nProvide verification and documentation that there is a valid basis for claiming that I am required to pay the debt to the current creditor. For example, can you provide a copy of the written agreement that created my original requirement to pay? \\n\\nIf you are asking that I pay a debt that somebody else is or was required to pay, identify that person. Provide verification and documentation about why this is a debt that I am required to pay. \\n\\nThe amount and age of the debt, including : A copy of the last billing statement sent to me by the original creditor. \\n\\nState the amount of the debt when you obtained it, and when that was. \\n\\nIf there have been any additional interest, fees or charges added since the last billing statement from the original creditor, provide an itemization showing the dates and amount of each added amount. In addition, explain how the added interest, fees or other charges are expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or are permitted by law. \\n\\nIf there have been any payments or other reductions since the last billing statement from the original creditor, provide an itemization showing the dates and amount of each of them. \\nIf there have been any other changes or adjustments since the last billing statement from the original creditor, please provide full verification and documentation of the amount you are trying to collect. Explain how that amount was calculated. In addition, explain how the other changes or adjustments are expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law. \\n\\nTell me when the creditor claims this debt became due and when it became delinquent. \\n\\nIdentify the date of the last payment made on this account. \\n\\nHave you made a determination that this debt is within the statute of limitations applicable to it? Tell me when you think the statute of limitations expires for this debt, and how you determined that. \\n\\nDetails about your authority to collect this debt. \\n\\nI would like more information about your firm before I discuss the debt with you. Does your firm have a debt collection license from my state? If not, say why not. If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license. \\n\\nIf you are contacting me from a place outside my state, does your firm have a debt collection license from that place? If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license. \\n\\n\\nI have asked for this information because I have some questions. I need to hear from you to make an informed decision about your claim that I owe this money. I am open to communicating with you for this purpose. In order to make sure that I am not put at any disadvantage, in the meantime please treat this debt as being in dispute and under discussion between us. \\n\\nIn addition to providing the information requested above, please let me know whether you are prepared to accept less than the balance you are claiming is owed. If so, please tell me in writing your offer with the amount you will accept to fully resolve the account. \\n\\nThank you for your cooperation. Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Member\n",

XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). \\n\\nXXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13.  Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and American General attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. \\n\\nThe contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. \\n\\nI notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. \\n\\nYou should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. \\n\\nI intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. \\n\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you, Thank you.\n",

             We posted item [ s ] for sale on XXXX XXXX  and other websites. Someone interested in buying the same. We have told that it costs {$120.00} and transfer the same to our account. I have shared email id of my bank account. I have told that item will be shipped after receiving the amount. they have called nextday and told that by mistake t they transferred XXXX instead of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I have checked my bank account and i can see amount for {$1200.00}. i have decided to send money back and took his email id. i have transferred the money of {$1100.00} ( using XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX ). They told that it went to their old/closed account and they said that have called XXXX and sent money back to my account. I have checked my bank account and i saw credit of {$1100.00}. He asked me to transfer to his other email id since first transfer didnt work. I did the same. Second time he told money didnt go through since his account locked due to low balance. He told that he called XXXX and cancel the same. I saw second credit of {$1100.00}. He asked me to transfer {$1100.00} this time to his sister account. I tried to transfer the same from XXXX XXXX XXXX and failed sine max limit per day exceeded. I have used my Chase to transfer the amount. On XX/XX/XXXX he told that he is able to unlock account and as part of initial transfer he accidentally transferred twice and that got processed after unlock I have checked my bank account and can see credit of {$1200.00}. I have decided to send it back so sent to his email id. He again told that somehow money went to his old/closed account and his account is locked again. He told that he called XXXX and cancelled the same and he requested me to transfer the excess amount so that he can unlock his account. This time i have transferred {$1200.00} to his another sister account from my chase account and waiting for credit from XXXX. After sometime he told that he is able to unlock and issue resolved. He told that money will come by EOD. \\n\\nFrom this point he is not reachable. Not able to call/text. Next day surprisingly all the credits were not appearing and when i checked with Bank, they said they dont see of those credits and they told someone called 2 days back and ( on the day of my first transfer ) submitted Claims ( pretending that they are unable to deposit amount in ATM ) using my personal details and questions. Bank confirmed that there are total 3 claims created ( XXXX,XXXX,XXXX amounts ) and due to this i saw those credits. Bank provided me those claim numbers as well. Bank also told that he might have cancelled his transfer and thats why credit got reversed. I have told bank that i didnt create those and they said my personal details would have been compromised, XXXX  XXXX XXXX cancelled all those claims and debited the amount from my account. I have explained the situation to the bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and they created claim and investigating the same. \\n\\nI have visited Chase Bank and explained the situation and requested to cancel/dispute transactions. They said that nothing can be done from their side since i have transferred. I have told that i am victim of this scam but they said nothing can be done. \\n\\nAttaching all transactions made by me and couple of screenshots shared by other person confirming that money went to his old XXXX XXXX account instead of XXXX  XXXX XXXX account.\n",

I opened a Chase credit card account in or about XX/XX/XXXX. I made regular purchases of cryptos on XXXX using his Chase-issued credit card beginning in early XX/XX/XXXX. Up until and including XX/XX/XXXX, Chase treated all of my purchases on XXXX  as ordinary credit card Purchases under his cardholder agreement.\\n\\nWhen I made additional crypto purchases from XXXX, using the same Chase credit card, on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Chase suddenly treated all of these purchases as Cash Advances, and assessed at least {$90.00} in cash advance fees and over {$160.00} in cash advance interest charges ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ). Despite calling Chases customer service line to complain about the surprise charges on his account, Chase declined to remove them. I was forced to pay and did pay these surprise cash advance charges in full.\\n\\nAt no point did Chase attempt to notify me neither before nor immediately after I executed my latest crypto purchases that such purchases would be treated as Cash Advances rather than Purchases under his card member agreement.\\n\\nHad I known that Chase was going to begin treating my customary Purchases as Cash Advances, then I would not have used my Chase credit card to buy cryptos on or after XX/XX/XXXX, and would not have incurred or been forced to pay the cash advance fees and interest charges that Chase levied against me.\\n\\nChase Bank USA, N.A. is domiciled in New York and is one of the largest national banks and credit card issuers in the United States. In late XX/XX/XXXX, Chase abruptly altered its customers credit card terms without notice such that any crypto purchases made by card members would be treated as Cash Advances rather than Purchases.\\n\\nDue to my 0 % Transfers I made and 0 % APR on Purchases, this XXXX Transactions and Cash Advance Interest can not be paid in full till the other Balance is fully paid.\\n\\nThe Truth in Lending Act, at 15 U.S.C. 1637 ( i ) ( 2 ), requires credit card issuers to provide a written notice of any significant change, as determined by rule of the [ U.S. Consumer Financial Protection ] Bureau, in the terms... of the cardholder agreement between the creditor and obligor, not later than 45 days prior to effective date of the change.\n",

Applicable Cases : Approximately, XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) and XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), and Complaint on potentially deceptive credit card business practice based on corporate policy that is not fairly and properly administered : ( Complaint Below ) CHASE advertises a credit card service that appeals to XXXX XXXX frequent flyers , and I applied and obtained a card for use. After several months of using the card, I received a letter from CHASE that it has \" decided to close your [ my ] credit card because we [ they ] are no longer offering personal and business credit card accounts to current or former non-U.S. officials, their immediate families or close associates. '' Not only was this action poorly informed as CHASE did not both to verify my current immigration status in the States, but later action on its part against my family member ( wife ) points to a deceptive business practice under this particular credit card it offers and the promotional materials it disseminates. \\n\\nA while after my CHASE credit card account was shut down, after I have accrued over XXXX USD balance I had to pay back to clear the account, which I satisfactorily paid off in respect of my obligation. However, in being not so certain about the soundness of this CHASE action and policy that I called the headquarters to discuss and present my case against, my wife applied for a similar card. She was approved for a card, received it, began using the card ( we did as approved card has option for assigning a secondary card user ), and few months later, my wife received a similar later. Account to be closed on similar ground as was used in my earlier experience. \\n\\nCHASE has demonstrated inconsistency in its credit card offering services and practice. While I still doubt the proper application of such policy against me, its approval of my wife 's application presents more reason to doubt CHASE 's seemingly deceptive business practice that seems aimed at putting susceptible customers in depth. \\n\\nThis practice needs to be scrutinized so that any law or regulations the company is applying will be administered equitably and devoid of what appears to be deceptive features. \\n\\nPlease assist us address this matter, and please feel free to contact me at my email address or cellular number, XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX Disgruntled CHASE Customer ( former )\n",

                                                                          Hi, As a loyal and long time customer of such a reputed financial institution, don't we have to receive a personalized & honest explanation of a complaint raised by the customer!!! Is it too much to ask? I had submitted a complaint regarding the unsolicited and unfair closure of my chase XXXX credit card ( ends with XXXX ) after not getting a logical explanation from customer support of chase ( via phone ). Briefly, my XXXX XXXX Card was closed by Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and I was informed via a letter. The reason cited is \" We are closing your account because only merchant credits have been used to satisfy the balance on your account for 3 consecutive months. No other payments have been received. We are closing your credit card account ''. I still do not understand the meaning of \" merchant credit has been used to make payment, no other payments made ''. I am enrolled in Autopay, so if there is no due balance how come bank is expected to receive a payment? The letter sent by Chase on XX/XX/XXXX also stated that \" We sent you a letter last month ( which is XX/XX/XXXX ) telling you if this activity continued, your account will be closed '', which I DID NOT receive. According to bank 's customer support, on statement closing date- XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, they decided to close the account. I do have {$220.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX, for the purchases I made in XX/XX/XXXX, which the bank 's decision maker can easily see on the day of decision. I can understand the bank 's policy, but I do have some serious concern regarding the timeline bank is providing to the customer which to me does not make any sense. It is my humble request to go through my concern and provide me an explanation NOT A GENERIC STATEMENT saying that it is the bank 's policy. I am listing my concerns below- 1. I am holding this credit card account for last few years, never had any late payment, no failure to pay and have an excellent credit score. I used this XXXX XXXX XXXX card only to make purchases on XXXX, there were many months when I have not used this card, but never got any kind of notice from Chase before. On the month of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, I made few purchases from XXXX, some of the items were not delivered ( LOST ), and couple of items I returned, so eventually there were merchant credits. The items which were lost ( due to delivery issues ), XXXX returned the charges, which I guess is not my fault anyway. ALSO point to be noted that XXXX NEVER RAISED ANY CONCERN ABOUT THE ITEMS LOST OR RETURNED as the returned items were not working/defective. SO IF CHASE IS THINKING ( I AM ASSUMING AS I WAS NOT PROVIDED ANY EXPLANATION FOR SUDDEN CLOSURE OF MY ACCOUNT OTHER THAN MERCHANT XXXX XXXX ) THAT THERE ARE SOME SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY OR CUSTOMER IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG, I GUESS IN THAT CASE THE CONCERN SHOULD BE RAISED BY THE SELLER/MERCHANT WHICH IS IN THIS CASE IS XXXX. HOW COME CHASE IS HAVING AN ISSUE WITH MERCHANT CREDIT DUE TO LOST ITEM OR RETURNED ITEMS!!! During the busy months of XXXX, XXXX IS PROVIDING APOLOGY TO MANY CUSTOMERS INCLUDING MYSELF FOR THE LOST ITEM and for that they ARE PROVIDING MERCHANT CREDIT. SO I AM NOT SURE HOW COME A MERCHANT CREDIT DUE TO LOST/RETURNED ITEM IS FORCING A BANK TO CLOSE MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT KNOWING THE BACKGROUND STORY AND MOREOVER THE SELLER/MERCHANT ( XXXX ) IS NOT RAISING ANY CONCERN/RED FLAGS. Regardless, I made purchases in XX/XX/XXXX and that led to > {$200.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX \\n\\n2. Chase credit card service is letting me know an important information onXX/XX/XXXX ( as per the customer support 's information ) via REGULAR MAIL ( NOT CERTIFIED/REGISTERED ) which takes at least 5 business days to arrive, so I would have got that on XX/XX/XXXX. I DID NOT RECEIVE THAT LETTER. I am pretty sure it is not uncommon in USA to get letters/shipment LOST. All the Big Merchants like XXXX, XXXX acknowledge LOST ITEM /SHIPMENT, how come CHASE IS NOT TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION SPECIALLY DURING THE MONTHS OF HOLIDAYS!!! In THE SECOND LETTER ON XX/XX/XXXX CHASE IS LETTING ME KNOW ABOUT THEIR DECISION TO CLOSE THE  ACCOUNT. SO BASICALLY CHASE IS GIVING ME ONLY APPROX. 15-20 DAYS OF TIME TO WORK ON THE ISSUE IF I HAVE GOT THAT XX/XX/XXXX LETTER!!! DOES IT MAKE ANY SENSE? IF THIS ISSUE IS THAT IMPORTANT, MY QUESTION IS THEN- ( a ) Does Chase believe no letters/mails get misplaced or lost? How come they are giving only couple of weeks ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) of time to the customer before a major decision like closing the account is made? ( b ) WHY CAN'T CHASE PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE TIME 4-6 WEEKS OR AT LEAST 1-2 BILLING CYCLE TO THE CUSTOMER SO THAT IF ANYTHING IS WRONG, CUSTOMER CAN HAVE THE TIME TO EXPLAIN OR RECTIFY!! IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK? TO ME IT SEEMED THAT CHASE HAD MADE ITS DECISION TO CLOSING THE ACCOUNT IN MIND ON XX/XX/XXXX DUE TO SOME REASON ( WHICH IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR TO ME ) THAT'S WHY JUST LETTING THE CUSTOMER KNOW AND GIVING 2 WEEKS OF TIME TO ACT ON. \\n\\nXXXX. A customer like me, who never had any late payment/any interest on this account. Credit score is excellent ( >800 ). Does that customer deserve only 1 notice of 2 weeks about this major decision of closing the account. It will hit my credit score badly!! If this issue was that urgent, why can't chase let me know in little more advance instead of on XX/XX/XXXX OR GIVE ME 1-2 BILLING CYCLES OF TIME!!. This timeline of activities as well as the explanation of \" Merchant Credit '' is very weird, and also not directed towards customer friendly attitude. Don't you think the customer needs to know little more in advance and have at least a month or two before closing the account? HOW COME THE MERCHANT CREDIT IS CUSTOMER 'S FAULT WHERE MERCHANT IS HAPPY TO REFUND BUT THE BANK IS NOT HAPPY FOR NOT RECEIVING ANY PAYMENT ( WHEN IS THERE IS NOTHING DUE )!! \\n\\n4. I TRIED TO CONTACT CHASE CREDIT SERVICE SO MANY TIMES, I DID NOT GET ANY DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THESE CONCERNS WHICH I AM WRITING HERE. THE ONLY EXPLANATION I GOT WAS \" MERCHANT CREDIT WAS SATISFIED TO MAKE PAYMENT .... '' IF YOU READ MY CONCERNS THERE ARE ISSUES ABOUT THE TIMELINE CHASE IS PROVIDING TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED EVEN ASKING FOR SO MANY TIMES. EVEN TRIED TO CALL THE CHASE CREDIT CARD EXECUTIVE SERVICE DIVISION ( I MISSED A CALL FROM A LADY FROM THIS DEPT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE DID NOT LEFT AN EXTENSION NUMBER OR CALL BACK NUMBER ), BUT COULD NOT REACH AS IT REQUIRES PARTICULAR PERSON 'S EXTENSION NUMBER. THEN I CALLED THE CHASE CREDIT CARD SERVICE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND LEFT A REQUEST TO CALL ME BACK AS I HAVE MISSED THE CALL AND COULD NOT REACH THEM BACK DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF THEIR CONTACT INFORMATION. NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THE AGAIN!!! \\n\\nI AM AGAIN REQUESTING YOU TO PLEASE PROVIDE ME AN EXPLANATION OF THE CONCERNS I RAISED HERE. I am very annoyed with this whole situation and mentally devastated. I still do not understand what I did wrong that the credit card account got closed!!! \\n\\nI HOPE THIS TIME I WILL GET A PERSONALIZED RESPONSE ( addressing the concerns raised here ) NOT A GENERIC RESPONSE. \\n\\nThanks XXXX XXXX XXXX, MD Phone : XXXX [ Cell ] XXXX [ Home ]\n",

Before leaving, I called Chase Bank to let them know that I would be gone in XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, and then I would travel to XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, and that I would be back to XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The operator made a note on my account and I specified that I was letting them know to avoid having my card blocked as I would really need it. Today is Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and as I was trying to order a pizza, my card didnt go through. I then called the fraud prevention team. They didnt try to ID me, instead they asked me to go to a branch so a banker could ID me and override the lock on my card. I explained to them that I wasnt able to do that because as I explained before I left, I was in a foreign country. I spoke to 4 different people included the international team, none of them asked me for any information to ID me. I then called a banker that notarized a document for me on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX of the XXXX beanch, who proceded to make a 3 way call with someone on the phone from Chase. Again, besides asking for my name, no attempt at IDing me was made. When XXXX XXXX asked if there was any record of me calling to advise that I would be gone for 3 months, the agent on the phone said that she wasnt able to give any information from the account while [ I was ] on the phone and that I needed to go to a chase branch. I am now stuck in a foreign country without funds and ways to eat or even survive and Chase wont do anything to help regardless of the fact that I have been a client for 7 years and that I did what I was supposed to on my end. They never asked me for anything else than my name and card number, both of which I was able to provide. I asked them to please try and ID me and they were unable to do so. Please help me I need to be able to use my card\n",

paying off complete balance amount to XXXX. My closed Individual credit card information is missing in the XXXX  credit report since XX/XX/2018. I have communicated to XXXX  about this card, right name and address along with various details. I have also communicated to Chase Credit Card Company to update the right status of closed credit card to all credit bureaus and also Information/Grievance is part of the CFPB records. Chase has responded to me and CFPB that CHASE credit has been paid and closed with XXXX balance on XXXX XXXX and also Chase has communicated to all the credit bureau that my credit card is closed on XXXX XXXX but this information is missing in the XXXX   Credit Report. I have only used chase credit card for my purchases [ all my transactions are part of the statements ] and used as normal credit card and I never ever used any kind of benefits from chase. \\nCould CFPB kindly direct XXXX/Chase to update my closed chase credit card details in my credit report, which has been missing since XXXX. My closed individual chase credit should be part of the records for next 7 years.Its unlawful and fraud for removing my closed credit card details from my credit report.\n",

       "'RE : Complaint Against JP Morgan Chase, XXXX Home Lending Advisor, Ms. XXXX XXXX and Manager, Mr. XXXX XXXX SUBJECT : Refinancing Home Loan via Chase Home Loan No.  XXXX Mr. XXXX XXXX, with regards to your deference to Chase Executive office based upon your interpretation of my e-mail dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that the correspondence intimated a threat of suit, perhaps the terseness of the narrative may have animated such an inference, but it was merely a correspondence of frustration invoked by my interpretation of an apparent deficiency of candor in what would appear to be a simple and mechanical process based on basic Standards of Care. \\n\\nFrom XX/XX/XXXX until Friday, XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX, XXXX Home Loan Advisor, Agent of JP Morgan Chase unacceptable conduct along with email communication that is part of the record clearly supports the allegations of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices. \\n\\nCOMMON SENSE : The Standards of Care which affords common sense to prevail in a style articulated by our SCOUTUS as stated by the following : In interpreting this text, we are guided by the principle that [ t ] he Constitution was written to be understood by the voters ; its words and phrases were used in their normal and ordinary as distinguished from technical meaning. United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 731 ( 1931 ) ; see also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 188 ( 1824 ). Normal meaning may of course include an idiomatic meaning, but it excludes secret or technical meanings that would not have been known to ordinary citizens in the founding generation. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 ( 2008 ).\\n\\nOBLIGATIONS : In common language, the state of California articulates the predicate for an obligation by stating the following : CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE CCP PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS ( Preliminary Provisions enacted 1872. ) 26. Section Twenty-Six. An obligation is a legal duty, by which one person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing, and arises from : One- Contract ; or Two- Operation of law.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1873 -74, Ch. 383 ) COMMON LANGUAGE : The State of  California clarifies the meaning of the terms Contract or by Operation of Law with the following : CIVIL CODE CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGAGTIONS PART 1. OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL TITLE 1. DEFINITION OF OBLIGATIONS 1427. An obligation is a legal duty, by which a person is bound to do or not to do a certain thing.\\n\\n1428. Section Fourteen Hundred and Twenty-Eight. An obligation arises either from : One The contract of the parties ; or, Two The operation of law. An obligation arising from operation of law may be enforced in the manner provided by law, or by civil action or proceeding.\\n\\n( Amended by Code Amendments 1872 74, Ch. 612. ) A CONTEMPORANEOUS REVIEW OF  EVENTS It was XX/XX/XXXX, when my wife and I first made the acquaintance of Mrs. XXXX XXXX as a JP Morgan Chase, XXXX Home Lending Advisor NMLS ID XXXX, at the XXXX, CA branch where she introduced herself and represented that she has a 10-years tenure with JP Morgan Chase as a Home Lending Advisor. \\n\\nAs the more knowledgeable person, my wife engaged the financial details of the prospective Refinancing details of the conversation with Mrs. XXXX XXXX, articulating : 1. My wife shared with Ms. XXXX that she believed my Credit Score should be in the range of 700 720. \\n2. We disclosed that we did NOT want to take any cash out of the property.\\n\\n3. We also shared with her that we would be paying out of pocket the refinancing cost so please do not wrap any cost into the Loan. \\n4. We asked how long is Chases Refinance process and Ms. XXXX share 45 to 60 days. We asked whether or not if she could complete the process in 30 days since we would not be taking any cash out. She committed to completing the process in 30 days if we were able to forward all of the documents on the list she provided back to her on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. We committed to going home and forwarding to her all of the documents requested on Saturday, XXXX XXXX. \\n5. Ms. XXXX represented that we would not have to do an appraisal since XXXX XXXX the property at ; $ XXXX. \\n\\nMrs. XXXX XXXX further represented : 1. After we provided Ms. XXXX with a copy of our current Mortgage Statement. She completed her Calculation using the automated Mortgage Calculator on her desktop, using a Credit Score of XXXX then changing it to XXXX points. The calculation provided an Interest Rate of 3.87 %. \\n2. Ms. XXXX never disclosed to my wife and I that we would have to provide a Good Faith Fee of {$500.00}. \\n\\nAgain, my wife represented to Mrs. XXXX XXXX at the conclusion of the XX/XX/XXXX, meeting that she would immediately send over the requested loan documents as soon as we arrived home, which, Mrs. XXXX appeared to acknowledge in affirmation since it was before XXXX Oclock XXXX. \\n\\nITENARY OF ACTIVITY My wife sent over all of the documents to Ms. XXXX XXXX as represented as expeditiously upon arrival to home at approximately XXXX XXXX per the e-mail dated XX/XX/XXXX. \\nReply e-mail from Ms. XXXX indicated that she was gone for the day XX/XX/XXXX and would not return to the office until Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. Hello, I am out of office for the remainder of the day. I will however respond to emails Tuesday. For urgent matters reach out to the client care specialist assigned to your loan. Thank you and have a blessed day. Thank you for choosing Chase! \\nWhen we did not her from Ms. XXXX on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, my wife called her late Tuesday afternoon. XXXX represented that she never received the documents even though here email reply when documents were sent stated the above message. \\nMy wife asked XXXX to look into her Spam/Junk Box. That is when she confirmed she had the documents and that she would prepare the Loan Application. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX Ms. XXXX XXXX remits e-mail correspondence articulating the following : Hello, Hope all is well. \\nYour loan application is ready. Please connect with me once you review them. The rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower, [ Fico Scores, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, respectively ], but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do. \\n\\nOne item was missing, the home owners declaration page. \\n\\nPlease send that last item as well. \\n\\nRegards, XXXX If you are not 100 % satisfied with my service or your experience with Chase at any time, please let me or my manager know right away. Our contact information is below. \\n\\nThank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\nMy wife and I sent e-mail correspondence to Ms. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, stating : Hi XXXX : Below you state, the rate was higher due to the credit coming in a little lower. What is the Fico Score? What is the Rate you are now quoting on the application? \\n\\nWhat is Chase fee on buying down Points, would you kindly itemize them out so that me and my wife can review? \\n\\nWhat does your statement below mean where you state, but I will reach out to my management if there is anything we can do? \\n\\nLastly, the no-reply @ mail-chasemortgage email link for me to sign-up does not work! Also, if it did work, I would be unable to complete the application due to the fact that you DID NOT provide me with a Loan Application Number. We would like to complete this process within 30 days, which you stated that you would be able to make that work but I cant begin the process without a Loan Application Number as well as knowing what Rate you are now quoting and what my Fico Score is coming back at. Can you provide a copy of the credit report so that I can review it for discrepancies? \\n\\nI, We, look forward to your quick response. \\n\\nBest regards, XXXX XXXX and wife XXXX. \\n\\nLater in the afternoon of Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  EDT, Ms. XXXX XXXX remitted a reply e-mail in response to the Joint e-mail of my wife and I, sent at XXXX XXXX, by stating the following : Hello, I hope all is well. \\n\\nSo, for starters, the information you requested, the credit score range : XXXX  XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nYour mortgage loan number is XXXX.

Our contact information is below. Thank you for choosing Chase. \\n\\n\\nWHAT IS DECEPTION This communication portends several issues from my perspective ; first there is a matter of dubious candor as articulated in the plain language of California CIV 1709 1710, which articulate the following : CIVIL CODE-CIV DIVISION 3. OBLIGATIONS [ 1427 -3272.9 ] ( Heading of Division 3 amended by Stats. 1988. Ch. 160, Sec 14 ) Part 3. OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED BY LAW [ 1708 1725 ] ( Part 3 enacted 1872. ) 1709. One, who willfully deceives  another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers. \\n1710. A deceit, within the meaning of the last section, is either : 1. The suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true ; 2. The assertion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who has no reasonable ground for believing it to be true ; 3. The suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact ; or, 4. A promise, made without any intention of performing it.\\n\\n( enacted 1872 ) BACK AND FORTH BANTERING : Emails dispersed from myself to Ms. XXXX XXXX and my wife to Ms. XXXX XXXX, [ cc and her supervisor, Mr. XXXX XXXX eventually, Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX ] from the period of XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicate a pattern of deception enumerated in CIV 1710 ( 1 4 ) and may concurrently be in contravention of GOV 12927 ( c ) ( 1 ), which articulates the following narrative in part : GOVERNMENT CODE - GOV TLE 2. GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [ 8000 - 22980 ] ( Title 2 enacted by Stats. 1943, Ch. 134. ) DIVISION 3. EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT [ 11000 - 15986 ] ( Division 3 added by Stats. 1945, Ch. 111. ) PART 2.8. DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING [ 1290012996 ] ( Part 2.8 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) CHAPTER4.Definitions [ 12925-12928 ] ( Chapter 4 added by Stats. 1980, Ch. 992. ) 12927. As used in this part in connection with housing accommodations, unless a different meaning clearly appears from the context : ( c ) ( 1 ) Discrimination *** includes provision  of inferior terms, conditions, privileges, facilities, or services in connection with those housing accommodations. \\n\\n( d ) Housing accommodation means any building, structure, or portion thereof that is occupied as, or intended for occupancy as, a residence by XXXX or more families and any vacant land that is offered for sale or lease for the construction thereon of any building, structure, or portion thereof intended to be so occupied. \\n\\n( f ) Person includes all individuals and entities that are described in Section 3602 ( d ) of Title 42 of the United States Code, and in the definition of owner in subdivision ( e ) of this section, and all institutional third parties, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.\\n\\n( g ) Aggrieved person includes any person who claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or believes that the person will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur.\\n\\n( h ) Real estate-related transactions include any of the following : ( 1 ) The making or purchasing of loans or providing other financial assistance that is for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, improving, repairing, or maintaining a dwelling, or that is secured by residential real estate.\\n\\n( 2 ) The selling, brokering, or appraising of residential real property.\\n\\n15 U.S. Code 1639. Requirements for certain mortgages : ( a ) Disclosures ( 1 ) Specific disclosures in addition to other disclosures required under this subchapter, for each mortgage referred to in section 1602 ( aa ) [ 1 ] of this title, the creditor shall provide the following disclosures in conspicuous type size : ( A ) You are not required to complete this agreement merely because you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application.\\n\\n( o ) Affiliate defined for purposes of this section ; the term affiliate has the same meaning as in section 1841 ( k ) of title 12.\\n\\n( 1 ) Exemptions the Bureau may, by regulation or order, exempt specific mortgage products or categories of mortgages from any or all of the prohibitions specified in subsections ( c ) through ( i ), if the Bureau finds that the exemption ( A ) is in the interest of the borrowing public ; and ( B ) will apply only to products that maintain and strengthen home ownership and equity protection.\\n\\n( 2 ) Prohibitions : The Bureau, by regulation or order, shall prohibit acts or practices in connection with ( A ) mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be unfair, deceptive, or designed to evade the provisions of this section ; and ( B ) refinancing of mortgage loans that the Bureau finds to be associated with abusive lending practices, or that are otherwise not in the interest of the borrower.\\n\\nThe sole and exclusive disclaimer made by the agents of Chase, which appears to countervails 15 U.S. C. 1639 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) is the following statement : Ms. XXXX as an Agent for JP Morgan Chase lied when she stated to me and my wife that : 1. JP Morgan Chase uses the lower of the fico score when offering Loan Terms and Interest Rate to me and my wife. \\n\\n2. She lied when she presented to me and my wife that JP Morgan Chase selection of the lowest Fico Score was due to Chases Guideline ( s ) /Policy. \\n\\n3. When we asked for a copy of Chases Guidelines, she and her Manager, Mr. XXXX lied when they stated that JP Morgan Chase Guidelines are Internal documents and are not given out. \\n\\n4. When Ms. XXXX tried to cover Ms. XXXX lie. XXXX XXXX instructed myself and my wife during a phone call between the parties that the only thing we needed to do was to get a written Quote from a competitor and submit it back to her because Chase does meet their Competitors Pricing and Interest Rate. However, when we submitted a written Quote from a competitor, Mr. XXXX in support of Ms. XXXX stated in an email communication that Chase DOES NOT meet competitors pricing and since we had NOT provided a {$500.00} Good Faith Fee and did not submit all documentation [ which we did ] we had until end of business to complete the loan application reflecting the XXXX Fico Score and Pricing or cancel the process. \\n\\n5. Ms. XXXX email response to my wife when my wife sent her the competitors Pricing/Interest Rate using a XXXX Fico Score as Ms. XXXX instructed us to do with the words, where did you get this from. Never addressing that fact that the Interest Rate quoted was 3.625 % and we did what she asked of us.\\n\\n6. Ms. XXXX was asked NOT to load ANY of the cost into the Loan. She did it anyway and when asked several times to update the Loan Amount she did not complete that task until Friday, XXXX XXXX evening when she was on her way out the door for the week. \\n\\n7. Ms. XXXX lied when she sent me the initial MyHomeChase email to login and/or create login credentials in order to begin the process. Ms. XXXX FAILED to provide me with the Loan Application Number. When my wife called her regarding my inability to move forward before the 24 hours account creation expired, Ms. XXXX stated that she did not provide the Loan Application Number because she wanted me to give her a call when I discovered that I could not move forward. \\n\\n8. It was during my wife phone conference with Executive Director, Mr. XXXX XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX that he confirmed the lies that Ms. XXXX represented on behalf of Chase. It was disclosed that Chase DOES uses the Middle Fico Score not the lowest. It was also disclosed that Chase did not have any such Guideline ( s ) /Policy of using the lowest Fico Score as previously represented to us by Ms. XXXX XXXX It was disclosed that Ms. XXXX did NOT 10 years of experience as a Home Loan Advisor with Chase. Mr. XXXX further confirmed that Ms. XXXX has worked for Chase for several years as a Teller along with assisting other Loan Advisors. I believe he also stated that my home loan application was the first home loan application that Ms. XXXX has worked on ALONE. \\n\\nMr. XXXX in Good Faith did offer my wife the option for us to move the application over to Chases XXXX location, but my wife decided to give Ms. XXXX the benefit-of-the doubt and to allow her to learn from her mistakes and complete the application process. \\nI believe Mr. XXXX XXXX stated to my wife that he had a conversation with Ms. XXXX regarding the issues. \\n\\nHowever, it was a BIG MISTAKE to leave Ms. XXXX in place. It also appears that the conversation that Mr. XXXX had with Ms. XXXX DID NOT WORK! \\nThroughout Friday, XX/XX/XXXX late afternoon Ms. XXXX sent me several misleading emails informing me that my Loan Documents were ready for me to login to MyHomeChase to complete the loan application process and to paid the {$500.00} Good Faith Fee. \\n\\nI emailed her to alert her that the documents had NOT been updated and if she would please email me alerting me when to go back into the portal after she had updated the documents. She then sent me another email late Friday afternoon informing me that my update documents were ready for me to complete and that she would send me a separate email informing me how to access the updated documents. I waited for I believe 2 hours and I emailed her back to share with her that I had not received the separate email. Later in the afternoon/early evening my wife placed a call to her. Her response that she was sorry she missed the call but was out of the office for the remaining of the day and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nShortly, after that the separate email arrived. I login in once again to view the revised documents and they were still the OLD documents. I email Ms. XXXX back with both Mr. XXXX & Mr. XXXX on the email asking for their help with hanging the revised documents or assisting Ms. XXXX with hanging the revised documents. Neither Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX responded. \\n\\nHowever, Ms. XXXX did respond and informed me that the rate and pricing would be updated on Monday and that the only thing she did was to change the Loan Amount. \\nShe went on to let me know that Mr. XXXX nor Mr. XXXX could handled the process of hanging of the documents and to have a Nice Weekend. \\n\\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned ALL of the above behavior is a clear representation of Unfair Business Practices and Fraudulent Business Practices which my last email on Friday, XXXX XXXX that Mr. XXXX responded back to and forward to his Executive Office clearly reflects my DISDAINED for being subjected to [ 2 Trusted Agents of JP Morgan Chase ], Ms. XXXX and Mr. XXXX Fraudulent and Unlawful Conduct.'"

       "78310  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "78310  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed  \n",

       "21070  i have had flawless credit for yr ive had chase credit card chase freedom specifically since with no problem ever ive done many balance transfer in my life so i have plenty of experience i recently did a balance transfer with chase freedom for did many with other chase card but apparently not freeedom when i got my first bill my minimum payment was i was shocked i immediately called on the representative told me that the min payment was so high bc they were making me pay the balance transfer fee up front but my future payment would be around of total balance which is standard and the rate they advertise i went to pay the next payment on was once again shocked to see my minimum payment was i paid it but i have been trying to work this out with chase ever since apparently the representative was wrong i am actually expected to pay instead of the standard they normally charge bc that was written in my user agreement paperwork back in year ago they currently charge to everyone else in the world my other card including chase are all this is an unreasonable amt to expect someone to pay for credit card i have kid many other bill to pay they never warned me they were so off the chart with their minimum payment percentage except for my original paperwork in they offer everyone else term they change their term anytime it benefit them but wont budge to lower it to make this payment more affordable reasonable so i also asked them a soon a i found this out to refund my transfer fee so i could use it to transfer the balance to a different card with a more reasonable minimum payment they refused i also asked if they would transfer to my chase slate card which ha min pmt they also refused they will not work with me at all i am a responsible working person i would like to preserve my good credit i could easily transfer again to a different card but id have to pay another lump sum of again  \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "44  on i received an advertisement via email that new chase customers could get for opening a new chase total checking account with the set up direct deposit and an additional for new chase savings customers who open a chase savings account and deposit a total of or more in new money within business days and maintain a balance for days i careful read all of the disclosures and was sure to follow all steps correctly to be eligible for both offers to receive the combined offer i opened my accounts online on chase s website on to date i still have not received either offer despite numerous attempts to work with chase employees to resolve this on i deposited into the savings account well within the business days of account opening when i contacted chase at the end of to discuss my concern i called the customer service line and spoke with a supervisor he informed me there was nothing he could do without the coupon code i explained i do not have the coupon code at the time and the call ended i later found the coupon code and called back during this call a lady informed me that regardless of having the coupon code there was nothing that could be done to investigateresolve this she then told me the reason i did not receive the bonus offers for opening either account is because i did not enter the coupon code at the time i opened the account online that was the only reason i did not receive the bonus amounts during the online account opening process chase s website stated if you open the account online your coupon code will be automatically applied furthermore the email i received will be attached for reference specifically states your coupon code will be automatically applied account s subject to approval as a result two sources confirmed that the coupon code would be automatically applied therefore i dont recall entering the coupon because it was being added automatically for me i am very frustrated with my chase experience and the lack of payment of these bonus offers i rightfully earned after phone customer service supervisors told me there was nothing they could do i contacted local branch management they advised me to contact the phone customer service and said they could not help me i am very upset about this entire experience i want to be compensated to cover the and offers i should have earned i followed all of the terms and disclosures correctly please investigate this matter and contact me back thank you   \n",

reach out to you chase decided to close my checking accounts without any prior notification i am still unclear as to the reasons why my account where closed and i was not given an opportunity to provide an explanation if one is needed after much deliberation ive concluded that this was chases method of not having to provide me with the bonus under the promotion which i opened my accounts therefore i am writing to you in hopes of having the account reopened with the original promotion being honored since i was not given any reason or explanation for the accounts being closed i can only conclude that it had something to do with the multiple depositing of a check the events that led up to this are as follows on i deposited a check for into my chase account via mobile check deposit the day prior to me leaving for vacation in on the my sister deposited the same check into my account without my knowledge as i was still on vacation in upon my return i visited chase branch located at florida to exchange currency from back to dollars i was unaware of the check activity that took place while i was away at that time i was advised by the branch representative about the duplicate check deposit and my account block while i was at the branch i contacted my sister and she explained that she saw the check on my desk and deposited it for me as she thought i had forgot to do so before leaving for vacation as i was out of the country she stated she attempted to contact me to confirm but was unable to reach me and if you know anything about you will know that to communicate with the us from is difficult therefore in her innocence she went ahead and deposited the check into our joint account the young lady at the branch attempted to assist me by calling the main office to find out the parameters surrounding the block and the steps i needed to take to have it removed after explaining the situation to the representative on the phone the branch representative advised me that i would only need to wait one week for the check to be returned and the account would be unblocked since i had come into the bank with enough time to rectify the situation subsequently i opened two representative payee accounts with chase one for my sister and one for my mother without any issues a few days later all of the accounts were closed without any notification this caused a lot of confusion as i had gone to the social security office and arrangements had begun to have my mother and sisters monthly checks from social security deposited into these newly opened accounts this experience has led me to believe that i was stereotyped based on one mistake made by my family member and now i am unable to bank with chase i have been an honest banking customer for many years without any mishaps i was not informed or misinformed during this whole process which did not grant me the opportunity to take the necessary steps to rectify the error i am requesting to be able to open all accounts and if possible be given the opportunity to qualify for the new customer promotion which was originally offered with the opening of new accounts i believe chase is a fine institute and in the short time we were with your bank we were able to bank easier since we have such delicate banking circumstances thank you in advance for your assistance on this matter sincerely   \n",

customers and american consumers chase is engaged in an illegal systematic scheme in prematurely closing certain consumer accounts i am a victim as well as a witness of chase bank behavior chase has automatically closed accounts due to fraudulent activity or unauthorized activity without the investigation as required by law they then report this negative information to a cra which they own in part chase did not notify consumers of the closure and do not provide answers to consumers question and only provide the perfunctory statement that it was an internal andor a business decision they also do not perform the investigation thus saving money and violating consumer protection law chase has failed to properly review or process fraudulent activity or fraudulent claims before they close the account chase has fabricated information such as filing fraudulent sars reports so the pretext would appear more plausible chase bank is also violating the securities exchange commissions guidelines and chase bank charter chase bank has engaged in self enrichment chase bank has violated california banking law chase bank has violated consumer protection laws and is engaged in causing harm to consumers this behavior is recent and also demonstrated by cfpb and other regulatory agencies are investigating the behavior i encourage cfpb to do the same with chase i have attached the recent press release from cfpb regarding the investigation if one bank is doing this to consumers then all banks are engaged in this behavior of harm towards consumers   \n",

cover this amount so i anticipated an over draft fee for the transaction that caused this initial overdraw on wednesday my account was charged two additional overdraft fees my account is now overdrawn by in part due to in fees from the bank seeing that i did not have the funds for the initial overdraw it is an unreasonable policy that the bank would further overdraw my account when asked about any full or partial relief from the fees my request was denied because my account was ineligible for any further insufficient fund reversals   \n",

monitor his checking account with the statements that came to the home i also could see the account with my online banking app if i called the bank the bank would not release any information to me without my son on the phone i dont know if this is because of internal policies or privacy laws as time went by my son moved out on his own and did things by himself he didnt handle the checking account the way i would have like him to but he was on his own in the beginning of i noticed on my chase app that my sons checking account had been negative for a while i called my son and he stated that he was moving accounts to another bank and he had some repeating drafts still coming through his account he stated that he would take care of it by the end of the month sometime in the following month i no longer was able to view his account on my chase app i had assumed that he had cleared his balance and closed his account i have no other choice to believe this as chase doesnt release information about this account to me on i tried to open a savings account online at chase and was denied and given a collection telephone number at this moment i had a good idea that my son never cleared his account i called the number and they told me i had a balance of i was not happy but i understood that when i opened the account years ago i could be liable for something like this i authorized the representative to debit my savings account and clear the balance i asked the representative how long it would take for this to clear so that i could open an account online the representative stated that i would probably never be able to open an account online as this chargeoff never goes away i questioned the chase representative on why didnt someone attempt to resolve this with me before it got charged off she stated that they called several times i asked what phone number she called she could not give me the phone number that was called but verified that it wasnt mine but the number they had on file for that account aka one of my sons phone numbers i asked if any written notification was sent out she stated that writen notification had gone out but to the address on file for that account and that no written notification was sent to me at my address here is my issue chase has reported a charge off account with my name to i did not receive any phone calls or written notification prior to them charging off the account this is unfair trade practices chase can not have it both ways they should not be able to damage my report when they had not provided me with any notification on the account this causes me harm as it prevents me from opening online accounts at chase or other institutions the requested resolution is for chase to remove all negative reporting that is associated with this account from my name social security number or other identifiable means just to be clear i am not disputing my liability for the negative balance on my sons account if i would have been notified of the action prior to charging off i would have paid the balance to avoid this activity and handled this with my son directly if chase deems that i can not receive any communication on a account i should not be reported to for charge off activity on this account i have been a chase customer for at least years and keep figures of cash in their bank at all

could verify they were from my bank or country the representatives repeatedly told me i would receive a call back when i placed my request i never did every call i received was an sounding individual stating they are from chase and requesting my social security number no one in their right mind is giving their social out over the phone to someone from a call center nonetheless outside of the us given chase used tactics that any reasonable individual would presume may potentially be fraud renders their attempts to contact null and void they may save on labor costs by outsourcing to a foreign country but it undermines the validity of their process furthermore when i requested information to verify they were from chase they could not provide any proof when i asked for a call back from someone in the us or at a bank branch in my city or country they never did how would i ever presume there was an actual issue rather than a scam   \n",

                chase bank will not release the funds of the deposited check with no reason given i deposited the check on the and was told the funds would be available on the like they always have been in the past today the they send me an email saying the funds should be available on but it could take longer no reason given at all i am not overdrawn i have not had any fraud or problems with our account i have never had a check bounce or anything like that so i gave them a call they claimed twice after two calls that have not released the funds to them which is false i have confirmed with that they have released the funds to chase and have a cleared copy of the check there is no fraud hold or anything else other than them refusing to release the funds to me even though they said that has not released the funds they also added that they have business days to release the funds so basically they are now telling me two stories   \n",

                                   ny re chase account closed without cause attn consumer financial protection bureau after giving much thought to my experience i decided to reach out to you chase decided to close my checking account without any prior notification i am still unclear a to the reason why my account where closed and i was not given an opportunity to provide an explanation if one is needed after much deliberation ive concluded that this was chase method of not having to provide me with the bonus under the promotion which i opened my account therefore i am writing to you in hope of having the account reopened with the original promotion being honored since i was not given any reason or explanation for the account being closed i can only conclude that it had something to do with the multiple depositing of a check the event that led up to this are a follows on i deposited a check for into my chase account via mobile check deposit the day prior to me leaving for vacation in on the my sister deposited the same check into my account without my knowledge a i was still on vacation in upon my return i visited chase branch located at florida to exchange currency from back to dollar i was unaware of the check activity that took place while i was away at that time i was advised by the branch representative about the duplicate check deposit and my account block while i was at the branch i contacted my sister and she explained that she saw the check on my desk and deposited it for me a she thought i had forgot to do so before leaving for vacation a i was out of the country she stated she attempted to contact me to confirm but was unable to reach me and if you know anything about you will know that to communicate with the u from is difficult therefore in her innocence she went ahead and deposited the check into our joint account the young lady at the branch attempted to assist me by calling the main office to find out the parameter surrounding the block and the step i needed to take to have it removed after explaining the situation to the representative on the phone the branch representative advised me that i would only need to wait one week for the check to be returned and the account would be unblocked since i had come into the bank with enough time to rectify the situation subsequently i opened two representative payee account with chase one for my sister and one for my mother without any issue a few day later all of the account were closed without any notification this caused a lot of confusion a i had gone to the social security office and arrangement had begun to have my mother and sister monthly check from social security deposited into these newly opened account this experience ha led me to believe that i was stereotyped based on one mistake made by my family member and now i am unable to bank with chase i have been an honest banking customer for many year without any mishap i was not informed or misinformed during this whole process which did not grant me the opportunity to take the necessary step to rectify the error i am requesting to be able to open all account and if possible be given the opportunity to qualify for the new customer promotion which was originally offered with the opening of new account i believe chase is a fine institute and in the short time we were with your bank we were able to bank easier since we have such delicate banking circumstance thank you in advance for your assistance on this matter sincerely   \n",

chase is engaged in an illegal systematic scheme in prematurely closing certain consumer account i am a victim a well a a witness of chase bank behavior chase ha automatically closed account due to fraudulent activity or unauthorized activity without the investigation a required by law they then report this negative information to a cra which they own in part chase did not notify consumer of the closure and do not provide answer to consumer question and only provide the perfunctory statement that it was an internal andor a business decision they also do not perform the investigation thus saving money and violating consumer protection law chase ha failed to properly review or process fraudulent activity or fraudulent claim before they close the account chase ha fabricated information such a filing fraudulent sars report so the pretext would appear more plausible chase bank is also violating the security exchange commission guideline and chase bank charter chase bank ha engaged in self enrichment chase bank ha violated california banking law chase bank ha violated consumer protection law and is engaged in causing harm to consumer this behavior is recent and also demonstrated by cfpb and other regulatory agency are investigating the behavior i encourage cfpb to do the same with chase i have attached the recent press release from cfpb regarding the investigation if one bank is doing this to consumer then all bank are engaged in this behavior of harm towards consumer   \n",

fee for the transaction that caused this initial overdraw on wednesday my account was charged two additional overdraft fee my account is now overdrawn by in part due to in fee from the bank seeing that i did not have the fund for the initial overdraw it is an unreasonable policy that the bank would further overdraw my account when asked about any full or partial relief from the fee my request was denied because my account was ineligible for any further insufficient fund reversal   \n",

                                             approximately year ago i helped my son open a student checking account at chase bank while he was younger and in school i could monitor his checking account with the statement that came to the home i also could see the account with my online banking app if i called the bank the bank would not release any information to me without my son on the phone i dont know if this is because of internal policy or privacy law a time went by my son moved out on his own and did thing by himself he didnt handle the checking account the way i would have like him to but he was on his own in the beginning of i noticed on my chase app that my son checking account had been negative for a while i called my son and he stated that he was moving account to another bank and he had some repeating draft still coming through his account he stated that he would take care of it by the end of the month sometime in the following month i no longer was able to view his account on my chase app i had assumed that he had cleared his balance and closed his account i have no other choice to believe this a chase doesnt release information about this account to me on i tried to open a saving account online at chase and was denied and given a collection telephone number at this moment i had a good idea that my son never cleared his account i called the number and they told me i had a balance of i was not happy but i understood that when i opened the account year ago i could be liable for something like this i authorized the representative to debit my saving account and clear the balance i asked the representative how long it would take for this to clear so that i could open an account online the representative stated that i would probably never be able to open an account online a this chargeoff never go away i questioned the chase representative on why didnt someone attempt to resolve this with me before it got charged off she stated that they called several time i asked what phone number she called she could not give me the phone number that was called but verified that it wasnt mine but the number they had on file for that account aka one of my son phone number i asked if any written notification was sent out she stated that writen notification had gone out but to the address on file for that account and that no written notification was sent to me at my address here is my issue chase ha reported a charge off account with my name to i did not receive any phone call or written notification prior to them charging off the account this is unfair trade practice chase can not have it both way they should not be able to damage my report when they had not provided me with any notification on the account this cause me harm a it prevents me from opening online account at chase or other institution the requested resolution is for chase to remove all negative reporting that is associated with this account from my name social security number or other identifiable mean just to be clear i am not disputing my liability for the negative balance on my son account if i would have been notified of the action prior to charging off i would have paid the balance to avoid this activity and handled this with my son directly if chase deems that i can not receive any communication on a account i should not be reported to for charge off activity on this account i have been a chase customer for at least year and keep figure of cash in their bank at all time   \n",

chase bank hired clearly international call center rep to call me regarding issue with my account i repeatedly asked to speak with a u native or someone that could verify they were from my bank or country the representative repeatedly told me i would receive a call back when i placed my request i never did every call i received was an sounding individual stating they are from chase and requesting my social security number no one in their right mind is giving their social out over the phone to someone from a call center nonetheless outside of the u given chase used tactic that any reasonable individual would presume may potentially be fraud render their attempt to contact null and void they may save on labor cost by outsourcing to a foreign country but it undermines the validity of their process furthermore when i requested information to verify they were from chase they could not provide any proof when i asked for a call back from someone in the u or at a bank branch in my city or country they never did how would i ever presume there was an actual issue rather than a scam   \n",

release the fund of the deposited check with no reason given i deposited the check on the and was told the fund would be available on the like they always have been in the past today the they send me an email saying the fund should be available on but it could take longer no reason given at all i am not overdrawn i have not had any fraud or problem with our account i have never had a check bounce or anything like that so i gave them a call they claimed twice after two call that have not released the fund to them which is false i have confirmed with that they have released the fund to chase and have a cleared copy of the check there is no fraud hold or anything else other than them refusing to release the fund to me even though they said that ha not released the fund they also added that they have business day to release the fund so basically they are now telling me two story   \n",

       "21052  i received a days late reporting on credit reports from chase bank the late payment was on my chase freedom unlimited credit card after changing my address via chase s mobile app my statements continued to be sent to my old address for multiple months when our monthly payment amount changed we did not receive a statement from the bank and we believe chase was still sending them to our old address because of this we received a late payment report in of when our address was eventually changed in we received our first statement in months showing that we were late we paid the required amount at this time and called chase bank to inform them of the error after their initial investigation they concluded no bank error was made even though the statement were not being received and we tried multiple times to request statements by changing our address on their mobile app now we have attached our credit card to our online banking and so can see our statements online i can attach them showing that they were being sent to an old address for months after we requested a change of address via their mobile app i contacted them today to ask that the item be removed and to discuss in good faith before filing a complaint they did not change their original ruling they have concluded that there was no bank error and that they do not have the capacity to remove the late payment unless a bank error was committed however its a fact that banks have utilized their access to reporting to remove credit reporting issues in the past without specifically being required to prove bank error i believe their explanation as to why they can not remove the credit reporting is false and meant to discourage me from pursuing further my endevours to reverse this ruling on my credit report possibly this claim if false could be considered unethical as it discourages those with legitimate disputes from pursuing further action based on incorrect information provided by the credit department at chase   \n",

       "21052  i received a day late reporting on credit report from chase bank the late payment was on my chase freedom unlimited credit card after changing my address via chase s mobile app my statement continued to be sent to my old address for multiple month when our monthly payment amount changed we did not receive a statement from the bank and we believe chase was still sending them to our old address because of this we received a late payment report in of when our address was eventually changed in we received our first statement in month showing that we were late we paid the required amount at this time and called chase bank to inform them of the error after their initial investigation they concluded no bank error was made even though the statement were not being received and we tried multiple time to request statement by changing our address on their mobile app now we have attached our credit card to our online banking and so can see our statement online i can attach them showing that they were being sent to an old address for month after we requested a change of address via their mobile app i contacted them today to ask that the item be removed and to discus in good faith before filing a complaint they did not change their original ruling they have concluded that there was no bank error and that they do not have the capacity to remove the late payment unless a bank error was committed however it a fact that bank have utilized their access to reporting to remove credit reporting issue in the past without specifically being required to prove bank error i believe their explanation a to why they can not remove the credit reporting is false and meant to discourage me from pursuing further my endevours to reverse this ruling on my credit report possibly this claim if false could be considered unethical a it discourages those with legitimate dispute from pursuing further action based on incorrect information provided by the credit department at chase   \n",

       "21043  a heloc was taken out in but due the failure of the notary to appear for the signing of the document per the bank manager the loan went through as an unsecured line of credit in i took out a reverse mortgage with a different bank their title and escrow companies overlooked what originally was an unsecured heloc that somehow now was a secured heloc with my home used as collateral a little over a year ago the payment ballooned from a month to over per month from on i have not been able to pay those huge payments the deed of trust that is part of the heloc that is being used to foreclose on my property is a proven forgery that was recorded on at the county recorders office i have prepared a formal legally binding affidavit with evidence exhibits supporting the proof of my allegations that range from the official recorded deed of trust through the title and escrow companies final and formal financial report through many other levels of documentation the fraudulent recorded deed of trust would not have come to light had i been able to continue making the heloc payments know that i continued to make those payments only because the bank manager told me that it was an unsupported line of credit that i believed i was responsible to pay further i believe without a doubt that i can and have documented proof of these specific crimes forgery turning the document into a counterfeit to record that counterfeit document onto the public record sending copies of that fraudulent document repeatedly through the us mail making this a federal mail fraud case as far as the title insurance is concerned the title company is repeatedly disclaiming any financial responsibility for its error of not finding the recorded deed of trust and its omission of failing to pay it off as it did other bank loans note and are additional evidence documents that have come in since the attached affidavit was written please accept them as supporting statements for the affidavit letter of denial dated artfully sidesteps his companys errors and omissions in not locating then paying off the chase heloc ending in in while again stating they have no responsibility to me only to please pay close attention to his dismissive attitude see exhibit n exhibit n letter of denial dated pages among other things my response to mr points out that while his company may not have a financial obligation to me they most certainly do have one to who approved my reverse mortgage in see exhibit o further i outline to him what i see as the options they have available to them in order to correct their very serious errors and omissions their now repeated failures to find and pay off a recorded deed of trust that is an absolute lien on my property and their issuance of a clean and clear title to the reverse mortgage company is a misrepresentation at least and in fact it is now found to be a lie because the title is not clean and clear the reverse mortgage company thinks it is in first position when in fact they are in the second position exhibit o my response to letter of denial dater page   \n",

       "8   on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer has been completed however as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for i called whos automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claims department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system in both phone calls they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transactions are advertised as a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team   \n",

       "8   on i made a payment to an online retailer using chase quick pay with on the chase website i realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation product or response to any inquiry regarding the order and contacted chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailer bank i contacted chase via a secured message on explaining what happened and asked is there a way to reverse this transaction or do you have a contact at that can give me more information about the recipient that my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that the transfer ha been completed however a you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email some require the expertise of another team in order to assist you better in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claim department i was directed to call and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call a quickly a possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at and didnt have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask or what word and phrase i should use to get the information i was looking for i called who automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the bank app to initiate the transaction i called again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase s system because i used the bank app to perform the transaction she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation i ended the call and called chase again when i called chase the second time the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again i was once again transferred to the claim department who told me that i needed to contact to get the information i was looking for after i told her that i had already contacted them she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction are not secured she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipient banking information was not kept in the system in both phone call they asked if i initiated that transaction and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter during this whole process it felt like chase was not transparent about their policy regarding these type of transaction nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation these transaction are advertised a a fast safe and easy way to send money but seem to be a dangerous way to do business i feel deceived by chase s advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the member on their customer service team   \n",

       "21060  my account was hacked during i did not notice it until i received a on monday which was not ordered by me someone used my chase credit card saved on account to make the order i had reported this unauthorized transaction to both chase and right after i found it out in the morning of but so far it is not solved and chase decided that i should be responsible for the for the computer for shipping billed by during my first conversations with chase on on told me that since the item was sold by a third party seller using their platform they are not responsible for return suggest that i consult chase for further action chase replaced my credit card and also told me that i should not be responsible for the in the package i received there was no shipping receipt there is only the shipper s information on the outside of the box which is a private person s last name first name initial address and a phone number i called the number nobody answered so i have to wait for chase for further instructions however on chase rebilled me and claimed that provided them the correct mailing address and email address of mine i have the benefit of the transaction which means the laptop is in my hand i am shocked by chase s ridiculous solution and reasoning of course is able to provide my correct information because i have account and made purchases previously and the reason that the computer is still in my hand is because i am waiting for either chase or walmartcom to help me find out how to return the item and resolve this unauthorized transaction issue i still kept the sealed its original package in a corner of my living room in addition i am not benefited at all i have already four computers at home two desktops and two laptops i do not need any other computer not to mention that the shipped to me is a model the seller not only charged for a price more than its current value heshe also charged an absurdly high shipping price how can i benefited from this useless stuff that was not ordered by me i made a phone call with both chase and again on there is no progress at all informed me that from their end the case is closed it was not them who rebilled me chase disputing department said i have to provide documentation to prove that i did not made the order but how how should i prove that it was not me who went to to make the order i have already provided everything i know to them based on s information the order was placed on and shipped out by overnight i anyway had no time to prevent from receiving it also i live in a high rise apartment we have management office to take care of receiving packages so i did not have a chance to refuse accept of the item however i did inform both and chase in the earliest chance i can of this unauthorized transaction i think should have the resort to provide the ip of the fraudulent buyer it is chase s job to work with on this chase disputing department also said that as long as the address and card number are correct there is not necessary to verify the three digits secure code on the back of a credit card for chase to approve a transaction what i am so surprised by this news so when a card holder is hacked chase is not responsible for their loose security policy not to mention this card has annual fee but there is no security guarantee at all on chase ext set up a threeparty phone conference with me and customer service person person tried to call the third party seller during the conference but could not get through this person said it gave him an impression that the phone number is not a real business number and there must be something wrong but this person refused to provide any further information of the third party seller to either me or chase unless police is involved that is asked me to call police even in this situation chase still made no comments but only said that they will continue to investigate i called my local police office i can provide the phone number after the conference call officer i can provide his name helped me filed the report however the officer said police has no procedure to contact either chase or concerning this case it should be chase the bank to do the investigation i passed over the information of police report to chase however after i have done everything they asked me to do until today when i called chase at ext it made no progress the amount of money is still on my account   \n",

       "21060  my account was hacked during i did not notice it until i received a on monday which was not ordered by me someone used my chase credit card saved on account to make the order i had reported this unauthorized transaction to both chase and right after i found it out in the morning of but so far it is not solved and chase decided that i should be responsible for the for the computer for shipping billed by during my first conversation with chase on on told me that since the item was sold by a third party seller using their platform they are not responsible for return suggest that i consult chase for further action chase replaced my credit card and also told me that i should not be responsible for the in the package i received there was no shipping receipt there is only the shipper s information on the outside of the box which is a private person s last name first name initial address and a phone number i called the number nobody answered so i have to wait for chase for further instruction however on chase rebilled me and claimed that provided them the correct mailing address and email address of mine i have the benefit of the transaction which mean the laptop is in my hand i am shocked by chase s ridiculous solution and reasoning of course is able to provide my correct information because i have account and made purchase previously and the reason that the computer is still in my hand is because i am waiting for either chase or walmartcom to help me find out how to return the item and resolve this unauthorized transaction issue i still kept the sealed it original package in a corner of my living room in addition i am not benefited at all i have already four computer at home two desktop and two laptop i do not need any other computer not to mention that the shipped to me is a model the seller not only charged for a price more than it current value heshe also charged an absurdly high shipping price how can i benefited from this useless stuff that was not ordered by me i made a phone call with both chase and again on there is no progress at all informed me that from their end the case is closed it was not them who rebilled me chase disputing department said i have to provide documentation to prove that i did not made the order but how how should i prove that it was not me who went to to make the order i have already provided everything i know to them based on s information the order was placed on and shipped out by overnight i anyway had no time to prevent from receiving it also i live in a high rise apartment we have management office to take care of receiving package so i did not have a chance to refuse accept of the item however i did inform both and chase in the earliest chance i can of this unauthorized transaction i think should have the resort to provide the ip of the fraudulent buyer it is chase s job to work with on this chase disputing department also said that a long a the address and card number are correct there is not necessary to verify the three digit secure code on the back of a credit card for chase to approve a transaction what i am so surprised by this news so when a card holder is hacked chase is not responsible for their loose security policy not to mention this card ha annual fee but there is no security guarantee at all on chase ext set up a threeparty phone conference with me and customer service person person tried to call the third party seller during the conference but could not get through this person said it gave him an impression that the phone number is not a real business number and there must be something wrong but this person refused to provide any further information of the third party seller to either me or chase unless police is involved that is asked me to call police even in this situation chase still made no comment but only said that they will continue to investigate i called my local police office i can provide the phone number after the conference call officer i can provide his name helped me filed the report however the officer said police ha no procedure to contact either chase or concerning this case it should be chase the bank to do the investigation i passed over the information of police report to chase however after i have done everything they asked me to do until today when i called chase at ext it made no progress the amount of money is still on my account   \n",

                                       i made a purchase of on i made payments of on and on the minimum payment was the closing date was please see attached statement that statement shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on however when i got the statement it shows that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance in of in the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase thank you in advance for your assistance respectfully   \n",

called to ask chase bank why they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info they showed that on the of i was very late on my bill and owed to bring this balance down to and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the to being it to they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was days late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped points when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats   \n",

executive office that i spoke with opened claim on my behalf she said once my claim was assigned to an executive office employee that person would contact me at the number on file mid my case was

multiple claims that were opened against an account i had since closed she claimed she only received two of the claims against the account after speaking with me she assured me she was going to investigate all the claims made that were made beginning at the end of on i noticed multiple payments being deducted from my chase checking account in the description all i saw were numbers on i called to see why money was being debited from my account of course all i got was s voicemail i left a message requesting a return call by i still had not received a return call i called once again because money was still being debited from my account this time i got a hold of her explanation for the debited funds was a bit odd she told me that while they were investigating these open claims money was still going to be debited and there was nothing she could do about it finally on i received a voicemail from to call her as soon as possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that told me they closed their investigation of my claims and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their investigation became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation   \n",

tuesday i used chase quick pay with to submit two different payments security deposit and month rent that was required to move into a rental i was supposed to move into on saturday the home owner then tried to get more money out of me and i finally pieced together i was being scammed since was offered through my chase bank online portal i thought it was part of chase and i would be afforded protections after i realized i was being scammed i contacted chase and got the run around finally ending up talking to in the chase claims dept i was told not a part of chase and since my payments were pier to pier there was no obligation on the part of chase to help get my money back said i should have read the fine print and should only be used to send money to people i know if that is the case then chase should have had an upfront notice stating you are aware that scam artists and pirates prefer because theres no recourse after they get your money and chase doesnt care ive done a lot of research on since getting scammed and i think it is bs that chase chose to partner with the number one tool used by scam artists because theres basically no verification required to set up an account and that chase promotes it as their own internal payment system giving the illusion id be afforded the same protections i get with the other chase family of products im also very upset that chase made it this easy for this scam artist to now have my personal information   \n",

            my mortgage is with chase my payments were being made by paying early each month was the provider of to chase evidently was sold to on transferred the files and told that chase said i was bankrupt and to terminate the processes did and did not pay chase any longer i have received no communication from anyone on this i was going to open a checking account at chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid i called and they said that will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy which i am not in since the mortgage holder would know after much pain i was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to so they can restart my payments however i had to make a complete payment pay late fees and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history was negligent with the files transfer and was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered what can be done i have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me no one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances i thought that i am entitled to all records about myself i am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run must have been really evil and doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person did not let me know they were changing services i can provide only the mortgage verification from chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed evidently did not use a human review process to read only accept checked fields of bad records   \n",

sapphire reserved card and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draws the payment from my bank account the payment normally takes several hours to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business days i normally schedule the payment two days in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekends and how many business days there are before the first of the month i have made payments for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instances the credit card is saying payments have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instances i know i made the payments on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fees when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisors they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown as posting and so they refunded the late fees and interest charged more recently for this past it occurred again and then for i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for recently its saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fees and interested for both and i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situations as well and am hoping they will resolve it but its now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card and other credit cards that they experience this as well i dont know if its just errors in these companies systems or if it is purposeful as a way for them to collect late fees and interest charges from unsuspecting customers i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protections laws and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumers wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect consumers across the country   \n",

made a purchase of on i made payment of on and on the minimum payment was the closing date was please see attached statement that statement show that i had an outstanding purchase balance of on i have enclosed the previous month statement to show that there were no other purchase prior to the one on however when i got the statement it show that i still have a purchase balance of i have a promotional balance in of in the promotional balance was a difference of apparently the payment above the minimum payment required by chase i thought would be applied to the purchase was applied to the promotional balance first it is my understanding that once the minimum payment ha been met payment in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first this is not the first time that chase ha skirted u financial law to turn a larger profit i need help in rectifying this problem because my logic fell on deaf ear at chase thank you in advance for your assistance

the credit bureau that i was day late on a payment that was already paid off when i called i got this info they showed that on the of i was very late on my bill and owed to bring this balance down to and be finished with the bill i paid that amount on the same day the to being it to they say that i tried to make another payment for later that same day and in a few day that came back a a return payment the man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for since i didnt owe anything they updated my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount they reported to the credit bureau that i was day late for not paying what accrued to be the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fee and said they would remove them i still have in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app additionally because they reported me being late my credit score dropped point when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own i think thats   \n",

finally on i received a voicemail from to call her a soon a possible i returned her call once school was dismissed for the day it was at that point that told me they closed their investigation of my claim and decided not to reverse their decision when asked what research they used to complete their investigation became short and told me i would have to subpoena the information at that point i hung up because i felt that it was a lose lose situation   \n",

two different payment security deposit and month rent that was required to move into a rental i was supposed to move into on saturday the home owner then tried to get more money out of me and i finally pieced together i was being scammed since was offered through my chase bank online portal i thought it was part of chase and i would be afforded protection after i realized i was being scammed i contacted chase and got the run around finally ending up talking to in the chase claim dept i was told not a part of chase and since my payment were pier to pier there was no obligation on the part of chase to help get my money back said i should have read the fine print and should only be used to send money to people i know if that is the case then chase should have had an upfront notice stating you are aware that scam artist and pirate prefer because there no recourse after they get your money and chase doesnt care ive done a lot of research on since getting scammed and i think it is b that chase chose to partner with the number one tool used by scam artist because there basically no verification required to set up an account and that chase promotes it a their own internal payment system giving the illusion id be afforded the same protection i get with the other chase family of product im also very upset that chase made it this easy for this scam artist to now have my personal

sent to so they can restart my payment however i had to make a complete payment pay late fee and have now late payment that will be on my credit file and payment history was negligent with the file

on my credit report and had to pay fee for something that was done to me no one will give me the record although they are about me and my finance i thought that i am entitled to all record about myself i am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureau and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run must have been really evil and doesnt really read what they are given or even contact the person did not let me know they were changing service i can provide only the mortgage verification from chase a the rest of the business refuse to provide written or electronic data they say that they only the computer transferred the file and were processed evidently did not use a human review process to read only accept checked field

and the payment is due the first of the month to pay the bill i can go through the chase credit card website and it automatically draw the payment from my bank account the payment normally take several hour to be completed although they do state that it can take up to two business day i normally schedule the payment two day in advance of when my payment is due to ensure that it is received on time taking into account weekend and how many business day there are before the first of the month i have made payment for this credit card on time for every single month however on at least four instance the credit card is saying payment have been late and they charge a late fee and interest charge for the first two instance i know i made the payment on time but the company said it was posted late and so they charged fee when i found out i called the credit card company and spoke to their customer service representative and eventually after talking to supervisor they acknowledged that their system inappropriately delayed when the payment was shown a posting and so they refunded the late fee and interest charged more recently for this past it occurred again and then for i went online and made the payment but when i got my statement for recently it saying that the payment was never received and so it charged late fee and interested for both and i am tying to talk to them to get them to address these situation a well and am hoping they will resolve it but it now seeming to be a pattern and i have heard from others who have this credit card and other credit card that they experience this a well i dont know if it just error in these company system or if it is purposeful a a way for them to collect late fee and interest charge from unsuspecting customer i am lucky in that i am familiar with consumer protection law and so know how to call them and challenge them but i worry that many consumer wont notice or wont know how to challenge them and so just pay them i am wondering if others have complained about this to cfpb and so perhaps it is in fact a pattern that requires investigation thank you for your time and consideration and for all you do to help protect

       "21003  my car was stolen on the police recovered it on and my primary insurance company deemed it a total loss i also have gap insurance thru a subsidiary of the loan is thru chase bank i contacted chase bank customer service who transferred me around times having to repeat the same story to different people they finally transferred me to a department that was now in charge of my account during this time period i did not receive any information from chase bank they did not contact me by phone to inform me in writing regarding any information on my account on i made a payment of which is my car payment chase had assessed me a late charge but waived the late charge on chase then received and credited a payment from my insurance company in the amount of on further chase received and credited to my account a payment from my gap insurance company of on chase refuses to acknowledge those payments on my behalf from my insurance companies and that they credited to my account as payments on my account and has destroyed my credit score by reporting me as latedelinquent they have done this because as one of their customer service representatives explained to me payments from my insurance company on my behalf dont count as payments really they have received payments and credited payments on my loan from my insurance companies on my behalf yet they can just erroneously ruin my credit because they have some internal policy that will accept the money but wont accept payments on my loan on my behalf i am not seeking any type of financial compensation although i do believe they should also waive the late charge they have assessed me of on after receiving payment from my insurance company i am seeking relief from chase bank s internal policies that penalize customers for no good reason and to remove the derogatory credit information that they placed onto my credit reports which is now on my report for years the credit bureau s wont do anything they take the side of the creditors frankly it is amazing i am the victim of a crime with my car being stolen and now i am the victim of corporate arrogance from chase bank who is destroying my credit for years thank you   \n",

       "21003  my car was stolen on the police recovered it on and my primary insurance company deemed it a total loss i also have gap insurance thru a subsidiary of the loan is thru chase bank i contacted chase bank customer service who transferred me around time having to repeat the same story to different people they finally transferred me to a department that was now in charge of my account during this time period i did not receive any information from chase bank they did not contact me by phone to inform me in writing regarding any information on my account on i made a payment of which is my car payment chase had assessed me a late charge but waived the late charge on chase then received and credited a payment from my insurance company in the amount of on further chase received and credited to my account a payment from my gap insurance company of on chase refuse to acknowledge those payment on my behalf from my insurance company and that they credited to my account a payment on my account and ha destroyed my credit score by reporting me a latedelinquent they have done this because a one of their customer service representative explained to me payment from my insurance company on my behalf dont count a payment really they have received payment and credited payment on my loan from my insurance company on my behalf yet they can just erroneously ruin my credit because they have some internal policy that will accept the money but wont accept payment on my loan on my behalf i am not seeking any type of financial compensation although i do believe they should also waive the late charge they have assessed me of on after receiving payment from my insurance company i am seeking relief from chase bank s internal policy that penalize customer for no good reason and to remove the derogatory credit information that they placed onto my credit report which is now on my report for year the credit bureau s wont do anything they take the side of the creditor frankly it is amazing i am the victim of a crime with my car being stolen and now i am the victim of corporate arrogance from chase bank who is destroying my credit for year thank you   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumers i believed this to be safe as it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost years and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant has refused to answer my inquiries and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant looks entirely legitamite and is even using the faces of highly successful brands with individuals linked to their social media without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holders to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore as this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage makes a point to deceptively position this app as under the branch of chase banking service and as such imply a degree of entitlement to its customer service protection protocols chase has your back which reads on the very same link as the tab is most certainly not true this places consumers at risk when using this mobile service and does not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public as it stands to be potentially devastating i have plans to file reports with all corresponding authorities as well as notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who works in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such as chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that needs to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",

       "21069  i am not familiar with pay and did not understand the great risk this provides to consumer i believed this to be safe a it was through my chase bank app i have been with chase for almost year and trust their mobile banking and now am sadly regretful i am being told to deal with the merchant except the merchant ha refused to answer my inquiry and now shut down communication the website of the said merchant look entirely legitamite and is even using the face of highly successful brand with individual linked to their social medium without their consent in performing research of the phone number and other associated information available through pi it is very clear this merchant is continually creating new account title holder to perpetuate this cycle of fraud furthermore a this is a non fixed voip being used i believe they are fraudulently using the identity of the real chase bank told me they wouldnt even investigate report this to or allow me to file a report or take any potential recourse for the matter there isnt even a protocol in place to address this issue yet the chase mobile app verbiage make a point to deceptively position this app a under the branch of chase banking service and a such imply a degree of entitlement to it customer service protection protocol chase ha your back which read on the very same link a the tab is most certainly not true this place consumer at risk when using this mobile service and doe not flag the concern of chase in the slightest at minimum the risk of using on your mobile banking app must realistically be made aware to the public a it stand to be potentially devastating i have plan to file report with all corresponding authority a well a notify and contact the individual whose identity is being misused to inform him i also intend to urge my neighbor who work in television that the news network should perhaps present the risk of using and integrated banking apps to the public i understand fraud and scamming are overwhelming rampant but a banking mogul such a chase not having any recourse of action is simply a risk that need to be disclosed more throughly i would not have clicked on the to link to the extent i did if i would have been better informed   \n",
